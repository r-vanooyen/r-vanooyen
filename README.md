ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @r-vanooyen('94), i am a software engeneer and consultant and program since 2015 in java and common java web frameworks and dev-ops tools.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming microservices, dev-ops, microcontroller and some more mostly with java-spring and k8s (and all in between).

ðŸŒ± In my freetime iâ€™m currently learning to design microcontrollers (on esp basis) and improving my skills with some new microservices frameworks.

ðŸ“« If you got some ideas to improve my projects, feel free to create an issue in that repo.
