- 👋 Hi, I’m @r-vanooyen('94), i am a software engeneer and consultant and program since 2015 in jave and common java web frameworks and dev-ops tools.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming microservices, dev-ops, microcontroller and some more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to design microcontrollers (on esp basis) and improving my skills with some new microservices frameworks.
- 💞️ I’m currently not looking to collaborate on other open sources, because I want to improve my own skills first.
- 📫 If you got some ideas to improve my projects, feel free to create an issue in that repo.
